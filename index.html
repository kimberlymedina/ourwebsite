								<div class="desc">Sandwich, in its basic form, slices of meat, cheese,
								or other food placed between two slices of bread. Although this mode of
								consumption must be as old as meat and bread, the name was adopted only
								in the 18th century for John Montagu, 4th earl of Sandwich, who had sliced 
								meat and bread brought to him at the gaming table so that he could continue
								to play as he ate. His title lent the preparation cachet, and soon it was 
								fashionable to serve sandwiches on the European continent, and the word was 
								incorporated into the French language. Since that time the sandwich has been
								incorporated into virtually every cuisine of the West by virtue of its simplicity
								of preparation, portability, and endless variety.</div>

								enclosing the seed or seeds. Thus, apricots, bananas, and grapes, as well as 
								bean pods, corn grains, tomatoes, cucumbers, and (in their shells) acorns and
								almonds, are all technically fruits. Popularly, however, the term is restricted
								to the ripened ovaries that are sweet and either succulent or pulpy. For treatment
								of the cultivation of fruits, see fruit farming. For treatment of the nutrient 
								composition and processing of fruits, see fruit processing.</div>

								<div class="desc">Fishes are animals that live and swim in the water 
								(although you might see a fish like a mudskipper or walking catfish 
								crawling on land), are cold-blooded (except for tunas and marlins and 
								mako sharks that are warmer than the water), breathe using gills (usually,
								but lungfish and some others have lungs), have backbones (but not always 
								of bone, such as in sharks, which are cartilage), have a scaly skin (except
								for eels, which are scale-less), and have various fins instead of limbs (except
								for a few that do actually have limbs, like lungfish and coelacanth).</div>
