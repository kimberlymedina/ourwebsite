							<div class="desc">For a memorable meal the quality of the service 
							is something that guests often remember as much as the food and 
							drink served.
							<br>
							<br>

							That means that restaurant servers must show extensive knowledge 
							of all types of cuisine and dishes, especially the ingredients and 
							cooking style of the dishes on an a la carte menu. They will need to
							know and understand the methods of preparation and serving, along with 
							the tools used.
							<br>
							<br>
							Regardless of whether it is a self-service cafeteria or a five star hotel
							restaurant good manners, a smart appearance, and impeccable personal hygiene
							are equally essential.</div>

						Working closely with an interior design team, we work up a concept for what your

						Cafeteria services include a huge variety of home-style food prepared and served 
						for our guests. Multiple stations offer guests many choices and increase service
